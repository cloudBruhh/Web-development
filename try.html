    <h1> <u> SPORTS</u> </h1>
    <p>
        Sport is a physical activity or game,[1] often competitive and organized, that maintains or improves physical
        ability and skills.
        Sport may provide enjoyment to participants and entertainment to spectators.[2] The number of participants in a
        particular sport can vary from hundreds of people to a single individual.
        Sport competitions may use a team or single person format,
        and may be open,<br> allowing a broad range of participants, or closed,
        restricting participation to specific groups or those invited. Competitions may allow a "tie" or "draw",
        in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure there is only one winner.
        They also may be arranged in a tournament format, producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual
        champion by
        arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.

    <h2> Football</h2>
    <p> Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
        Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where
        the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in
        Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand);
        Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena
        football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby
        union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known
        as "football codes". There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball
        games played in many different parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be
        traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century,
        itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The expansion and cultural power of the British
        Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly
        controlled empire. <br> <br>By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already
        developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional
        football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League was founded in England,
        becoming
        the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various
        kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]</p>
    <h2> Cricket</h2>
    <p> <i>
            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at
            the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising
            two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and
            nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the
            bowler,
            bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit
            the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one
            run
            for each of these swaps. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the
            ball
            is bowled illegally.

    <h2><b>Volleyball</b></h2>
    <p> <b> <em>Volleyball </em> is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team
            tries
            to score
            points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.[1] It has been a part of
            the
            official
            program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball was introduced to the program
            at the
            Atlanta
            1996 Summer Olympics. The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting
            volleyball.
